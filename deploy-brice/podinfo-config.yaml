        "description": "A big, bold and beautiful nose of oily rum-like notes. Lightly raisinated fruit and spice drift above some lusciously creamy oak. Lovely maturity to the aromas, and very much like an old grain whisky. Superb depth with a refreshing citrus twist. The palate is quite tannic to begin with as the oak really grips. There is a depth of lightly oiled dried fruit orange peel, strawberry jam and baked apple. Smooth, subtle and fairly short finish.",
